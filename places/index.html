        <dt>Phandalin</dt>
        <dd>A town that was abandoned in the 10th century due to an orc attack, it has recently been resettled, primarily due to prospecting efforts in the area.
            There are around 50 well kept building made of logs and flagstones with three deep well producing water. An apple orchard to the west and <a href="#tresendar_manor" title="Tresendar">Tresendar manor</a> 
            to the east
        
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt id="tresendar_manor">Tresendar Manor</dt>
        <dd>Ruined from the outside, the manor still stood, but clearly in a poor, unmaintained state. It appeared much more like a castle than a simple place of
             dwelling, and was surrounded by a handful of trees and shrubs. The floors were made of flagstone and the walls were well-made stone blocks.</dd>

        <dt id="old_owl_well">Old Owl Well</dt>
        <dd>A strategically valuable watering hole, it is currently avoided due to the undead in the area. It was once a netheril watchtower that has crubled into obscurity. </dd>
