<h2>Redbrands</h2>
<p>
    The Redbrands mostly consisted of humans, male and female, 
    although a handful of bugbears were also in the bandit group.
     Each Redbrand wore a simple, dirty scarlet cloak. These cloaks
      were recognized by the undead in their hideout, Tresendar Manor, 
      and stopped them from attacking the bandits.

They were led by a mysterious wizard who they called Glasstaff.
