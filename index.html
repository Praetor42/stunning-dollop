    <h2>Background</h2>
<p>More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known
 as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern 
 known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great 
 magical power.</p>

<p>Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind
 that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could
  be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced <em>fan</em>-duh-lin) prospered as well.</p>

<p>But then disaster struck when ores swept through the North and laid waste to all in
 their path.</p>

<p>A powerful force of ores reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo
 Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their
  dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle
   destroyed much of the cavern.</p>

<p>Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was
 lost.</p>

<p>For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and
 opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded
  in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the
   area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important,
    the Rockseeker brothers— a trio of dwarves have discovered the entrance 
    to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines.</p>

<h2>The Forgotten Realms</h2>

<p>Just like a fantasy novel or movie,
 an adventure is set in a larger world. In fact,
  the world can be anything that the DM and players
   can imagine. It could be a swords-andsorcery 
   setting at the dawn of civilization, where
    barbarians battle evil sorcerers, or a
     post-apocalyptic fantasy where elves
      and dwarves wield magic amid the

wreckage of a technological civilization.
 Most D&D settings are somewhere between 
 those two extremes: worlds of medieval high fantasy 
 with knights and castles, as well as elven cities, 
 dwarven mines, and fearsome monsters.</p>

<p>The world of the Forgotten Realms is one
 such setting, and that’s where the story in 
 this adventure takes place.</p>

<p>In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the 
fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory
 and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways 
 of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur’s
  Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace
   and spell, questing against the terrifying powers
    that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the 
    ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving
     into secrets too dark for the light of day.
      Dragons, giants, demons, and unimaginable abominations
       lurk in dungeons, caverns, ruined cities, and the vast wild places of the world.</p>

      
<p>On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels
 and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers, sailors,
  and steel-hearted adventurers carrying tales of strange,
   glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can
    take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory
     far across the world. Thousands of restless would-be
      heroes from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages
       arrive in Neverwinter and the other great cities every
        year in search of wealth and renown.</p>

<p>Known roads may be well traveled, but they aren’t 
necessarily safe. Fell magic, deadly monsters, and 
cruel local rulers are all perils that you face when
 you travel in the Forgotten Realms. Even farms and
  freeholds within a day’s walk of a city can fall
   prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.</p>

<p>The regional map shows just a tiny part of this vast
 world, in a region called the Sword Coast. This is a
  region of adventure, where daring souls delve into 
  the wreckage of ancient strongholds and explore ruins
   of long-lost cultures. Amid a wilderness of jagged,
    snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, lawlessness, and monsters,
     the coast holds the greatest bastions of civilization,
      including the coastal city of Neverwinter.</p>
