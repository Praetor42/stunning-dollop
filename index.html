    <h2>Changes between versions</h2>
    <p>Very few changes between first and final draft since I had been working on it through the year. First is the addition of the contact page. Second is some minor changes to the footer
        , removing my contact email as that functionality is included in the contact page. Also reduced font size, shifted to left and included a small privacy notice, a suggestion of my father.
        Third is some minor html cleanup and validating. There is a link back to the forking navigation in the footer of each home page, it is simply to make it easier to navigate between
        first and final drafts for you, it would be removed from any final build.
