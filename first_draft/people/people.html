<dt>Lady Vesa Wernheardt</dt>
<dd>
    A well known paladin of Tyr, god of justice, she is currently in Phandalin acting as a representative of Neverwinter and the factions. Although 
    she is a member of the Lord's Alliance she is trusted enough to be an impartial arbiter, due to her oath of honesty and integrity. She belongs to a small sect known as 
    The Sisters of Mercy, a branch of Tyr worshippers that believe in moderating pure unrelenting justice with mercy and compassion. A powerful and traveled adventurer, She
    took the position in Phandalin as a way of taking a break. Her goal is the safety of the town, and as such will not leave to deal with problems she believes to be within
    the capabilities of the Grasping Otters.

kidnapper and he is using all of his connections as an entertainer to spread the word.  </dd>
