        <dt>Phandalin</dt>
        <dd>A town that was abandoned in the 10th century due to an orc attack, it has recently been resettled, primarily due to prospecting efforts in the area.
            There are around 50 well kept building made of logs and flagstones with three deep well producing water. An apple orchard to the west and <a href="#tresendar_manor" title="Tresendar">Tresendar manor</a> 
            to the east
        
        </dd>

        <dt>Neverwinter</dt>
        <dd>
            One of the city states of the Swordcoast, it is comparable to Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep.
            All local towns, such as Phandalin and Thundertree, fall under its umbrella. 
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Thundertree</dt>
        <dd>
            A town now in a ruined state, it used to be a key timber provider for the nearby Neverwinter.
            Placed on the edge of The Neverwinter woods, it was caught in the ashfall of Mount Hotenow's
            eruption. Ash zombies, presumed to exist due to the eruption, attacked the city which caused 
            it to be abandoned.

        <dt id="tresendar_manor">Tresendar Manor</dt>
        <dd>Ruined from the outside, the manor still stood, but clearly in a poor, unmaintained state. It appeared much more like a castle than a simple place of
             dwelling, and was surrounded by a handful of trees and shrubs. The floors were made of flagstone and the walls were well-made stone blocks.</dd>

        <dt id="old_owl_well">Old Owl Well</dt>
        <dd>A strategically valuable watering hole, it is currently avoided due to the undead in the area. It was once a netheril watchtower that has crumbled into obscurity. </dd>
